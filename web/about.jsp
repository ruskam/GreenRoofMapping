<h1>About</h1>
<p>Magna Systems is an experimental Google Maps API based web mapping application for monitoring world’s built and natural assets. It is developed by <a class="author" href="http://www.rustam.io">Rustam Kamberov</a> and <a class="author" href="http://www.bilalkarim.com">Bilal Karim</a>. We believe in making information accessible through rich, unique and interactive interfaces that utilize the power of maps.</p>
<br />
<p>Our first application is targeted towards researchers engaged in monitoring the health of green roof research projects across Canada from the University of Calgary, University of Western Ontario, and Saint Mary’s University.</p>
<br />
<p>We envision to continue developing this platform to support industries such as oil and gas, forestry, and more.</p>
